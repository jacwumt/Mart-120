controls up down arrows control the witch to move up and down.
Right arrow the witch shoots a fireball
the game ends as a loss if the cat gets to the witch
i wanted to make it so the fireballs would cause the cat to disapear enabling me to put a score associated with that
I could not find a way for the projectiles to interact with the actors, only if the actors touch each other
The game is therefore not complete but i think it should fulfill criteria (at best)
good luck
sometimes the cat randomly moves directly at the player at first usually resulting in a collision and loss.
sorry about that.
