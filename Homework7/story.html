  <h1>My Story</h1>

  <p>Last weekend I went fishing at Beavertail Pond in Beavertail Hill State Park with my dog, Bodhi. It was one of those calm Montana mornings where the water is glassy and the air still smells like pine. Bodhi trotted along the bank, occasionally splashing at the shallows while I cast a line toward the middle of the pond. We didn’t catch much, but that wasn’t really the point—it was just peaceful being out there, surrounded by mountains, watching the mist lift off the water.</p>
